abstract: Black phosphorus (BP) has recently attracted significant attention for its brilliant physical and chemical features. The remarkable strong light-matter interaction and tunable direct wide range band-gap make it an ideal candidate in various application regions, especially saturable absorbers. In this paper, ultrasmall black phosphorus quantum dots (BPQDs), a unique form of phosphorus nanostructures, with average size of 5.7 ± 0.8 nm are synthesized. Compared with BP nanosheets (BPNs) with similar thickness, the ultrafast nonlinear optical (NLO) absorption properties and excited carrier dynamics are investigated in wide spectra. Beyond the saturation absorption (SA), giant two photon absorption (TPA) is observed in BPQDs. BPQDs exhibit quite different excitation intensity and wavelength dependent nonlinear optical (NLO) response from BPNs, which is attributed to the quantum confinement and edge effects. The BPQDs show broadband photon-induced absorption (PIA) under the probe wavelength from 470 nm to 850 nm and a fast and a slow decay time are obtained as long as 92 ± 10 ps and 1100 ± 100 ps, respectively. The substantial independence for ultra-long time scales of pump intensity and temperature reveals that the carrier recombination mechanism may be attributed to a defect-assisted Auger capture process. These findings will help to develop optoelectronic and photonic devices operating in the infrared and visible wavelength region.
