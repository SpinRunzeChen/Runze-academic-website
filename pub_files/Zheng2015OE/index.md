abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), such as tungsten disulfide (WS2), are layered materials with strong in-plane bonding and weak out-of-plane interactions enabling exfoliation into two-dimensional layers of single unit cell thickness. Recent advances in nanoscale materials characterization and few layer TMDCs’ unique optical properties make them a research hot-spot in nonlinear optics. In this work, the nonlinear refractive index of monolayer WS2 has been characterized with Z-scan measurement under 800nm femtosecond pulsed laser excitation, and a value of n2 ≃ (8.1 ± 0.41) × 10−13m2/W is obtained. A shift from saturable absorption to reverse saturable absorption was observed at higher input pump intensities in the experiments. The transition process was analyzed using a phenomenological model based on two photon absorption, and the two photon absorption coeﬃcient was estimated about (3.7±0.28)×10−6𝑚/𝑊.
