With semiconductor transistors already at the nanometer scale, non-negligible phenomena including electrical leakage, device heat dissipation, and the quantum effects of electrons are getting increasingly critical. In order to prolong Mooreâ€™s law, an approach is to employ novel computing paradigms explored by looking for novel information carriers that can combine optimal performance and excellent energy efficiency. One of the emerging technologies that can complement CMOS technologies is spintronics (also known as magnetoelectronics or spin electronics), where information can be retained and processed by utilising the spin in addition to the charge of the electrons. It is possible to achieve low-power and low-heat computing/storage in CMOS-spintronics hybrid systems.

The concept of a skyrmion was firstly proposed by British nuclear physicist Tony Skyrme to describe the interactions of pions in the context of nuclear physics. A skyrmion is a topological quasiparticle excitation in classical continuum field theory, which is robust as long as the field is spatially continuous, and the edge effects are negligible. When it comes to magnetic skyrmions, they have the topological configuration that differs from the traditional magnetic vortex structure: the spins of the core point upwards, smoothly twist and gradually rotate downwards along both radial and angular directions with specific chirality. It originates from the interplay of two energy terms, including the isotropic Heisenberg exchange interaction and antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) which arises from spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and broken inversion symmetry

As for my PhD project, I would like to explore skyrmions for novel computations and skyrmion-based electronics, especially on modelling skyrmion-based nano-devices with logic/computing and memory functionality using a micromagnetics framework as well as developing circuit models for these devices towards their integration compatible CMOS technologies.
